# Food Adulteration Project

## Project Overview

### Objective
Our project aims to develop an AI-based solution that enables users to scan the ingredients of packed food items and determine their healthiness. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we will analyze the ingredients list to identify any potentially harmful chemicals or additives present in the food product.

### Solution Approach
The core functionality of our solution involves:
- **Image Processing**: Extracting text from the ingredients label using google vision Api.
- **Database Cross-Referencing**: Checking the ingredients against a database of known harmful substances.
- **User Interface**: Presenting the analysis results in a clear and understandable manner, providing actionable insights into the health implications of consuming the scanned product.

## Problem Statement
The prevalence of processed and packaged foods in modern diets has raised concerns about the potential health risks associated with artificial additives, preservatives, and other chemical substances commonly found in these products. Despite regulatory efforts to ensure food safety, consumers often struggle to decipher complex ingredients lists and assess the health implications of the products they purchase.

## Solution Benefits
Our solution addresses this problem by:
- Empowering consumers with the knowledge and tools to make informed decisions about the foods they consume.
- Providing real-time analysis of ingredients and highlighting any potentially harmful substances.
- Promoting healthier eating habits.
- Reducing the risk of adverse health effects associated with the consumption of processed foods.

## Features
- **Ingredient Scanning**: Users can scan the ingredients label of any packed food item.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Immediate feedback on the healthiness of the ingredients.
- **Harmful Substance Detection**: Identification and warning about potentially harmful chemicals and additives.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-understand presentation of analysis results.

## Technologies Used
- **Image Processing**: Google Vision Api to extract text from images.
- **Machine Learning**: Classifier Regression for predicting Health Risk Score and Hazardous Ingredients.
- **Database Management**: Storage and retrieval of information on harmful substances.
- **User Interface**: Using React.Js for development of a user-friendly application for interaction and results display.
